Hello there, my name is Columba Sanchez but call me Anita. I am a junior at Shidler majoring in Accounting and MIS. I think these two majors compliment each other very well. 
The reason I decided to take ITM 352 was because I enjoy learning about technology and want to learn more skills with technology. The goal is to become proficient in tecnology and gain knowledge to benefit me in the workforce. 
I hope we all get along and have a great time in ITM 352.
