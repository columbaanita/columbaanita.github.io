# About me
Hey everyone, it's great to meet you. My name is Columba Sanchez but please just call me Anita. I am a junior at Shidler majoring in accounting and soon to be a double major in MIS.
I'm from Los Angeles California and I really emjoy spending quality time with family and friends. I moved here in 2018 and have had a great time living here but I hope to travel more in the future. The reason I chose to take ITM 352 was because I enjoy learning about technology and am eager to learn new skils. I believe these two majors compliment each other very well and are both interesting. I really hope to get to know you all and hopefully we have a fun time in ITM 352.
