# About me
Hello there, my name is Columba Sanchez but call me Anita. I am a junior at Shidler majoring in accounting and MIS. 
The reason I decided to take ITM 352 was because I enjoy learning about technology and am eager to learn new skils. My goal is to become proficient in tecnology and gain knowledge to benefit me in the workforce.
